# Amazon OpenSearch Kotlin code examples

This README discusses how to run the Kotlin code examples for Amazon OpenSearch.

## Running the Amazon OpenSearch Kotlin files

**IMPORTANT**

The Kotlin code examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified credentials, and you may incur AWS service charges by running them. See the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details about the charges you can expect for a given service and operation.

Some of these examples perform *destructive* operations on AWS resources, such as deleting an # Amazon OpenSearch domain. **Be very careful** when running an operation that deletes or modifies AWS resources in your account. It's best to create separate test-only resources when experimenting with these examples.

You will find these examples: 

- **CreateDomain** - Demonstrates how to create a new Amazon OpenSearch Service domain.
- **DeleteDomain** - Demonstrates how to delete an Amazon OpenSearch Service domain.
- **ListDomainNames** - Demonstrates how to list Amazon OpenSearch Service domains.
- **UpdateDomain** - Demonstrates how modify a cluster configuration of the specified domain.

To run these examples, you can setup your development environment. For more information, 
see [Get started with the SDK for Kotlin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/get-started.html).
