# Amazon SageMaker Kotlin code examples

This README discusses how to run the Kotlin code examples for Amazon SageMaker.

## Running the Amazon SageMaker Kotlin files

**IMPORTANT**

The Kotlin code examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified credentials, and you may incur AWS service charges by running them. See the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details about the charges you can expect for a given service and operation.

Some of these examples perform *destructive* operations on AWS resources, such as deleting a model. **Be very careful** when running an operation that deletes or modifies AWS resources in your account. It's best to create separate test-only resources when experimenting with these examples.

You will find these examples: 

- **CreateModel** - Demonstrates how to create a model in Amazon SageMaker.
- **CreateModel** - Demonstrates how to create a model in Amazon SageMaker.
- **CreateTransformJob** - Demonstrates how to start a transform job that uses a trained model to get inferences on a dataset.
- **DeleteModel** - Demonstrates how to delete a model in Amazon SageMaker.
- **DescribeTrainingJob** - Demonstrates how to obtain information about a training job.
- **ListAlgorithms**  - Demonstrates how to list algorithms.
- **ListModels** - Demonstrates how to retrieve a list of models.
- **ListNotebooks** - Demonstrates how to list notebooks.
- **ListTrainingJobs** - Demonstrates how to retrieve a list of training jobs.

To run these examples, you can setup your development environment to use Gradle to configure and build AWS SDK for Kotlin projects. For more information, 
see [Get started with the AWS SDK for Kotlin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-kotlin/latest/developer-guide/setup.html).
