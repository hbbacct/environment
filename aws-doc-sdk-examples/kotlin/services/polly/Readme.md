# Amazon Polly Kotlin code examples

This README discusses how to run the Kotlin code examples for Amazon Polly.

## Running the Amazon Polly Kotlin files

**IMPORTANT**

The Kotlin code examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified credentials, and you may incur AWS service charges by running them. See the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details about the charges you can expect for a given service and operation.

You will find these examples: 

- **DescribeVoices** - Demonstrates how to produce a list of voices available for use when requesting speech synthesis with Amazon Polly.
- **ListLexicons** - Demonstrates how to produce a list of pronunciation lexicons stored in an AWS Region.
- **PollyDemo** - Demonstrates how to convert text into speech.

To run these examples, you can setup your development environment to use Gradle to configure and build AWS SDK for Kotlin projects. For more information, 
see [Get started with the AWS SDK for Kotlin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-kotlin/latest/developer-guide/setup.html).
