## Running the AWS Elemental MediaConvert Kotlin files

**IMPORTANT**

The Kotlin code examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified credentials, and you may incur AWS service charges by running them. See the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details about the charges you can expect for a given service and operation.

You will find these examples: 

- **CreateJob** - Demonstrates how to create AWS Elemental MediaConvert jobs.
- **GetJob** - Demonstrates how to get information about a specific AWS Elemental MediaConvert job.
- **ListJobs** - Demonstrates how to get information about all completed AWS Elemental MediaConvert jobs.

To run these examples, you can setup your development environment to use Gradle to configure and build AWS SDK for Kotlin projects. For more information,
