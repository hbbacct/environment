# Amazon Textract Kotlin code examples

This README discusses how to run the Kotlin code examples for Amazon Textract.

## Running the Amazon Textract Kotlin files

**IMPORTANT**

The Kotlin code examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified credentials, and you may incur AWS service charges by running them. See the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details about the charges you can expect for a given service and operation.

You will find these examples: 

- **AnalyzeDocument** - Demonstrates how to analyze a document.
- **DetectDocumentText** - Demonstrates how to detect text in the input document.
- **DetectDocumentTextS3** - Demonstrates how to detect text in an input document located in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.
- **StartDocumentAnalysis** - Demonstrates how to start the asynchronous analysis of a document.

To run these examples, you can setup your development environment to use Gradle to configure and build AWS SDK for Kotlin projects. For more information, 
see [Get started with the AWS SDK for Kotlin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-kotlin/latest/developer-guide/setup.html).
