# Amazon Translate Kotlin code examples

This README discusses how to run the Kotlin code examples for Amazon Translate.

## Running the Amazon Translate Kotlin files

**IMPORTANT**

The Kotlin code examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified credentials, and you may incur AWS service charges by running them. See the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details about the charges you can expect for a given service and operation.

You will find these examples: 

- **BatchTranslation** - Demonstrates how to translate multiple text documents located in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.
- **DescribeTextTranslationJob** - Demonstrates how to describe a translation job.
- **ListTextTranslationJobs** - Demonstrates how to list all translation jobs.
- **TranslateText** - Demonstrates how to translate text from one language to another.

To run these examples, you can setup your development environment to use Gradle to configure and build AWS SDK for Kotlin projects. For more information, 
see [Get started with the AWS SDK for Kotlin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-kotlin/latest/developer-guide/setup.html).
