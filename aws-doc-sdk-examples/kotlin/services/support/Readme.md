# Support code examples for the SDK for Kotlin

## Overview
This README discusses how to run and test the AWS SDK for Kotlin examples for AWS Support.

AWS Support is one-on-one, fast-response support from experienced technical support engineers. The service helps customers use AWS products and features. With pay-by-the-month pricing and unlimited support cases, customers are freed from long-term commitments.

## ⚠️ Important
* The SDK for Kotlin examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified credentials. 
* Running these examples might incur charges on your account. For details about the charges you can expect for a given service and API operation, see [AWS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/).
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). 
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Code examples

The credential provider used in all code examples is Shared credentials. For more information, see [Using credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-kotlin/latest/developer-guide/credential-providers.html).

### Get started

- [Hello Support](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/kotlin/services/support/src/main/kotlin/com/example/support/HelloSupport.kt) (describeServices command)

### Single action

Code excerpts that show you how to call individual service functions.

- [Add a communication to a case](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/kotlin/services/support/src/main/kotlin/com/example/support/SupportScenario.kt) (addCommunicationToCase command)
- [Add an attachment to a set](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/kotlin/services/support/src/main/kotlin/com/example/support/SupportScenario.kt) (addAttachmentsToSet command)
- [Create a case](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/kotlin/services/support/src/main/kotlin/com/example/support/SupportScenario.kt) (createCase command)
- [Describe an attachment](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/kotlin/services/support/src/main/kotlin/com/example/support/SupportScenario.kt) (describeAttachment command)
- [Describe services](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/kotlin/services/support/src/main/kotlin/com/example/support/SupportScenario.kt) (describeServices command)
- [Describe severity levels](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/kotlin/services/support/src/main/kotlin/com/example/support/SupportScenario.kt) (describeSeverityLevels command)
- [Describe cases](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/kotlin/services/support/src/main/kotlin/com/example/support/SupportScenario.kt) (describeCases command)
- [Describe communications](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/kotlin/services/support/src/main/kotlin/com/example/support/SupportScenario.kt) (describeCommunications command)
- [Resolve the case](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/kotlin/services/support/src/main/kotlin/com/example/support/SupportScenario.kt) (resolveCase command)

### Scenarios 

Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple functions within the same service.

- [Get started with cases](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/kotlin/services/support/src/main/kotlin/com/example/support/SupportScenario.kt) (Multiple commands)

## Run the AWS Support Kotlin file

**Be very careful** when running an operation that deletes or modifies AWS resources in your account. We recommend creating separate test-only resources when experimenting with these examples.

To run these examples, set up your development environment. For more information, 
see [Get started with the SDK for Kotlin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-kotlin/latest/developer-guide/get-started.html). 


 ## Test the AWS Support Kotlin file

You can test the Kotlin code example for AWS Support by running a test file named **SupportTest**. This file uses JUnit 5 to run the JUnit tests and is located in the **src/test/kotlin** folder. For more information, see [https://junit.org/junit5/](https://junit.org/junit5/).

You can run the JUnit tests from an IDE, such as IntelliJ, or from the command line. As each test runs, you can view messages that inform you if the various tests succeed or fail. For example, the following message informs you that Test 3 passed.

	Test 3 passed

**WARNING**: _Running these JUnit tests manipulates real AWS resources and might incur charges on your account._

 ### Properties file
Before running the JUnit tests, you must define values in the **config.properties** file located in the **resources** folder. This file contains values that are required to run the JUnit tests. If you do not define all values, the JUnit tests fail.

Define this value to successfully run the JUnit tests:

- **fileAttachment** - The file can be a simple saved .txt file to use as an email attachment.
