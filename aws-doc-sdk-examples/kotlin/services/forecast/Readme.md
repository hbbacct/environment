# Amazon Forecast Kotlin code examples

This README discusses how to run the Kotlin code examples for Amazon Forecast.

## Running the Amazon Forecast Kotlin files

**IMPORTANT**

The Kotlin code examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified credentials, and you may incur AWS service charges by running them. See the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details about the charges you can expect for a given service and operation.

Some of these examples perform *destructive* operations on AWS resources, such as deleting a named query example. **Be very careful** when running an operation that deletes or modifies AWS resources in your account. It's best to create separate test-only resources when experimenting with these examples.

You will find these examples: 

- **CreateDataSet** - Demonstrates how to create a data set for the Amazon Forecast service.
- **CreateForecast** - Demonstrates how to create a forecast for the Amazon Forecast service.
- **DeleteDataset** Demonstrates how to delete a data set that belongs to the Amazon Forecast service.
- **DeleteForecast** Demonstrates how to delete a forecast that belongs to the Amazon Forecast service.
- **DescribeForecast** - Demonstrates how to describe a forecast for the Amazon Forecast service.
- **ListDataSetGroups** - Demonstrates how to list data set groups for the Amazon Forecast service.
- **ListDataSets** - Demonstrates how to list Amazon Forecast data sets.
- **ListForecasts** - Demonstrates how to list forecasts for the Amazon Forecast service.

To run these examples, you can setup your development environment to use Gradle to configure and build AWS SDK for Kotlin projects. For more information, 
see [Get started with the AWS SDK for Kotlin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-kotlin/latest/developer-guide/setup.html).
