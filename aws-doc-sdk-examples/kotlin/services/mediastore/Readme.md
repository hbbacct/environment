# AWS Elemental MediaStore Kotlin code examples

This README discusses how to run the Kotlin code examples for AWS Elemental MediaStore.

## Running the AWS Elemental MediaStore Kotlin files

**IMPORTANT**

The Kotlin code examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified credentials, and you may incur AWS service charges by running them. See the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details about the charges you can expect for a given service and operation.

You will find these examples: 

- **CreateContainer** - Demonstrates how to create a MediaStore container.
- **DeleteContainer** - Demonstrates how to delete a given MediaStore container.
- **DescribeContainer** - Demonstrates how to describe a given MediaStore container.
- **ListContainers** - Demonstrates how to list your MediaStore containers.

To run these examples, you can setup your development environment to use Gradle to configure and build AWS SDK for Kotlin projects. For more information, 
see [Get started with the AWS SDK for Kotlin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-kotlin/latest/developer-guide/setup.html).
