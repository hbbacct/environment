# Amazon S3 code examples for the SDK for Swift
## Overview
This folder contains code examples demonstrating how to use the AWS SDK for
Swift to use the Amazon Simple Storage Service (`S3`). This README discusses how
to run these examples.

Amazon Simple Storage Service (`Amazon S3`) is storage for the internet. You can
use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from
anywhere on the web.

## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). 
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Code examples

### Single actions
Code excerpts that show you how to call individual service functions.
* [Copy an object](./basics/Sources/ServiceHandler/ServiceHandler.swift) (`CopyObject`)
* [Create a bucket](./basics/Sources/ServiceHandler/ServiceHandler.swift) (`CreateBucket`)
* [Delete a bucket](./basics/Sources/ServiceHandler/ServiceHandler.swift) (`DeleteBucket`)
* [Delete an object](./basics/Sources/ServiceHandler/ServiceHandler.swift) (`DeleteObject`)
* [Delete multiple objects](./DeleteObjects/Sources/ServiceHandler/ServiceHandler.swift)
* [Get an object from a bucket](./basics/Sources/ServiceHandler/ServiceHandler.swift) (`GetObject`)
* [List objects in a bucket](./basics/Sources/ServiceHandler/ServiceHandler.swift) (`ListObjectsV2`)
* [Upload an object to a bucket](./basics/Sources/ServiceHandler/ServiceHandler.swift) (`PutObject`)

### Scenarios
Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple functions within the same service.
* [Amazon S3 basics](./basics/Sources/ServiceHandler/ServiceHandler.swift)

<!-- ### Cross-service examples
Sample applications that work across multiple AWS services.

## Running the examples
To build any of these examples from a terminal window, navigate into its directory then use the command:

```
$ swift build
```

To build one of these examples in Xcode, navigate to the example's directory
(such as the `DeleteObjects` directory, to build that example), then type
`xed .` to open the example directory in Xcode. You can then use standard Xcode
build and run commands.

### Prerequisites
See the [Prerequisites](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/swift#Prerequisites) section in the README for the AWS SDK for Swift examples repository.

## Tests
⚠️ Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.

To run the tests for an example, use the command `swift test` in the example's directory.
